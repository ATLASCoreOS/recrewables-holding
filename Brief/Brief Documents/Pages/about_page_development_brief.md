  ReCrewables was founded by maritime professionals who have lived the challenges 
  our clients face. As former Masters, technical managers, and fleet operations 
  specialists, we understand the complexities of offshore renewable energy 
  operations because we've managed them firsthand.
  
  Our transition from operational roles to consultancy was driven by a simple 
  principle: the best maritime advice comes from professionals who have actually 
  done the job. With 30+ years combined experience across Europe, the UK, and 
  as far as Singapore, we bring real-world expertise to every project.
  
  Today, while continuing to manage active CTV operations, we leverage our 
  operational knowledge to help vessel owners, offshore developers, and energy 
  companies optimize their maritime operations and navigate the complexities 
  of the offshore renewable sector.
